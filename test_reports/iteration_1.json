  "summary": "Completed comprehensive testing of cyber-defense simulation system. All major components working correctly: attack simulation, ML-based threat detection, RL training, real-time dashboard, and MongoDB integration. System successfully generates synthetic network logs, trains ML models, detects threats, creates alerts, and displays real-time metrics.",
